#Integer-to-words

The brief for this project was to write a script that would turn any int input from 0-1m into a text output, so
`123567 => one hundred twenty-three thoustand five-hundred and sixty seven`

You can view the [tests](https://github.com/dansteele/int-to-words/blob/master/tests/numbers_test.rb) to see what the expected result for a given input is.
You can also try running the demo.rb.

###This is a revised version
My initial attempt worked about 95% of the time, and was **714** lines long. Condensed, this one is about 60.
